As a parent, I like the integrated curriculum that Sonoma Academy offers, and believe strongly Clara-Sophia would benefit from  it.  She is a girl who likes to delve deeply into topics, and do her best;  she would benefit from the combination of History and English you offer, as well as Math and Science.  She likes her work to be relevant and connected to her life, and I think this approach offers her that. 

Clara also does well with dynamic, exciting and compassionate teachers - she has been fortunate to have had many, and she does her best work when she is in sync with her teachers.  She was drawn immediately to that quality in the teachers she met at SA at the Open House.  

She also would thrive in a smallish atmosphere with a diverse student body - she makes friends easily and likes to have active, goal-oriented friends, which we gather are the norm at SA.  Also, has had some unusual life experiences that make her appreciate people from many walks of life, and we gather she will find that as well at SA.
