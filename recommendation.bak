Please write a statement of recommendation for your child; a parent/guardian's perspective on the applicant's strengths and weaknesses is valuable.


Clara-Sophia is a lively, extraverted girl.  Based on what I understand of Howard Gardner's analysis of different learning styles, I think she is a kinesthetic and inter-personal learner.

She has high expectations of herself and is willing to work hard to achieve them.  She loves to ice skate and perform in theater,  and has become highly organized in order to fit these activities into her school schedule.  She makes friends easily and has a very kind heart, especially toward younger children and those with handicaps.  She likes to stay active and is very good about finding an activity or chore for herself if she should find herself with downtime (not often!).
